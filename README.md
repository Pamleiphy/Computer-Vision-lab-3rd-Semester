Experiment 1: Image Acquisition and Display

This experiment implements the basic operations of digital image handling using OpenCV. It includes reading images from disk, displaying them on the screen, saving processed images, and performing color space conversions such as RGB to grayscale.

Experiment 2: Image Enhancement

This experiment focuses on improving image quality by applying contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and brightness and contrast adjustment techniques to enhance the visual appearance of images.

Experiment 3: Image Transformation

This experiment demonstrates geometric image transformations including scaling, rotation, translation, and affine transformations to modify image size, orientation, and position.

Experiment 4: Edge Detection

This experiment implements classical edge detection algorithms such as Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny to identify object boundaries and compare their effectiveness on different images.

Experiment 5: Morphological Operations

This experiment applies morphological operations including erosion, dilation, opening, and closing to remove noise, enhance object shapes, and improve structural features in images.

Experiment 6: Convolution, Filtering, and Motion Blur

This experiment demonstrates convolution-based filtering techniques such as mean, Gaussian, and sharpening filters, along with motion blur simulation using convolution kernels.

Experiment 7: Corner Detection

This experiment focuses on detecting significant interest points in images using Harris corner detection and feature extraction techniques such as SIFT.

Experiment 8: Texture Segmentation using Gabor Filters

This experiment performs texture-based image segmentation by creating a bank of Gabor filters and extracting texture features from images.

Experiment 9: Image Segmentation

This experiment implements image segmentation techniques including thresholding and region-based methods and compares their results with learning-based segmentation approaches.

Experiment 10: Object Detection

This experiment focuses on detecting objects in images using traditional computer vision techniques and deep learning–based object detection with pre-trained models.
